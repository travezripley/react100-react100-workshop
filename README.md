## Project Submission

To submit this project, please deploy this website using Now.

```bash
# navigate to the project
$ cd ~/projects/{project-name}

# run "now" to deploy the site
$ now
```

After running that command, you should see the following output:

```bash
> Deploying ~/projects/{project-name} under your@email.com
> Ready! https://{project-name}-skckceswsd.now.sh (copied to clipboard)
```

A URL to your project has been pasted to your clipboard, so the next thing to do is [Submit your project](https://goo.gl/forms/wx8DLSus7s88lk043)

And that's it! Once you submit the project, you can move onto the next assignment.  An instructor will evaluate your work; giving feedback if necessary.
